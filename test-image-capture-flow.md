## Test Steps

### Manual Test Workflow

1. **Start Camera**
   - Click "Smart Capture" button
   - Verify viewfinder frame overlay is visible
   - Verify corner frames, grid, and focus indicator appear
   - Verify instructions show at top: "Position property within frame ‚Ä¢ AI detection active"

2. **Capture Photo**
   - Position property within the viewfinder frame
   - Click the large white capture button
   - Verify camera closes after capture

3. **Auto-Detection Phase**  
   - Verify "Auto-detecting subject..." progress appears
   - Should automatically transition to cropping mode

4. **Cropping Mode**
   - Verify cropping interface appears with:
     - Canvas with the captured image
     - Blue corner handles (draggable)
     - Help overlay with instructions
     - Enhanced frame overlay around crop area
   - Try dragging corners to adjust crop area
   - Verify "Auto-Detect" button works to re-run detection

5. **Complete Crop**
   - Click "Crop & Straighten" button
   - Verify "Processing..." state with progress
   - Should return to preview mode

6. **Preview Mode**  
   - Verify the displayed image is now the CROPPED version
   - Verify identification badge appears
   - Verify "Cropped image ready! Focused area will be analyzed" message
   - Verify green success message about processing

7. **Submit for Analysis**
   - Click "Analyze Property" or "Continue with AI"
   - Should navigate to prospect preview page
   - Verify the cropped image is used for prospect generation

## Expected Console Logs

Look for these key log messages to verify the flow:

```
üì∑ Photo captured, starting auto-detection pipeline
üîç AdvancedImageCapture: Starting auto-detection with URL: blob:...
ü§ñ Running auto-detection...
‚úÖ Auto-detection successful: {...}
üéØ Entering crop mode with detected subject
üé® Processing cropped image for prospect analysis...
üìè Cropped image details: {...}
‚úÖ Cropped image ready for prospect analysis: {...}
```

## Key Fixes Implemented

1. **Capture Frame Overlay**: Enhanced visibility with better borders, shadows, and grid
2. **Cropping Mode**: Always triggered after capture, with improved UX
3. **Focused Processing**: Cropped image replaces original for analysis
4. **Visual Feedback**: Better overlays, instructions, and progress indicators
5. **Quality Settings**: Higher resolution and quality for AI analysis

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

1. **Frame overlay not visible**: Check browser camera permissions
2. **Cropping mode not appearing**: Check console for auto-detection errors
3. **Wrong image analyzed**: Verify cropped image URL is used in handleCropComplete
4. **Poor crop quality**: Verify compression settings (85% quality, 2048px max)

The complete flow should now work seamlessly: **Capture ‚Üí Crop ‚Üí Focus ‚Üí Analyze**.
