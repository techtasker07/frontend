# AI Prospect Feature - Login Success Implementation

## Overview
This feature automatically prompts users with an AI-powered property analysis tool whenever they successfully log in to the application. It provides a seamless way for users to capture property images and get instant AI-generated insights.

## How It Works

### 1. Login Success Detection
- The `LoginSuccessHandler` component monitors the authentication state
- When a user successfully logs in (or registers), the `justLoggedIn` flag is set to `true`
- This triggers the welcome modal to appear

### 2. Welcome Modal
- Displays a stylish welcome message with the user's name
- Explains the AI Prospect feature benefits
- Provides options to "Start AI Analysis" or "Skip"
- Features animated elements and gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

### 3. AI Prospect Flow
When user clicks "Start AI Analysis":

1. **Image Capture Modal**
   - Camera access request for taking photos
   - Option to select images from device
   - Category selection dropdown for property type

2. **Prospect Preview Modal**
   - Displays the captured/selected image with category badge
   - Shows a randomly assigned prospect title as a clickable button
   - Displays investment cost information
   - When prospect button is clicked, shows detailed prospect information:
     - Project description
     - Development cost breakdown
     - Total investment required
   - Options to "Add as Prospect Property" or "Close"

3. **Add Prospect Property Modal** (if user chooses to add)
   - Pre-filled form with generated property data
   - User can edit and add additional details
   - Saves to database as a prospect property with associated prospects

### Login Flow

## Styling and UX

- Animated elements (pulse, bounce, fade effects)
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### User Experience

- Informative: Explains benefits before asking for camera access
