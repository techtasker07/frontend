# AI Prospect Flow Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the AI Prospect flow that automatically opens after successful login.

## Flow Sequence

### 1. Login Success
- When a user successfully logs in, the `LoginSuccessHandler` component detects this
- The handler automatically redirects the user to `/ai/welcome-back`

### 2. Welcome Page (`/ai/welcome-back`)
- Shows a welcome message with the user's name
- Explains the AI prospect feature
- Provides two options:
  - **Start Smart Analysis**: Proceeds to image capture
  - **Skip**: Goes directly to dashboard
- **Close button (X)**: Goes to dashboard

### 3. Image Capture Page (`/ai/capture-image`)
- Allows users to take a photo or select an image from gallery
- **Back button**: Returns to welcome page (if coming from login flow)
- **Close button**: Goes to dashboard and clears session data
- After image capture: Automatically generates 5 AI prospects and navigates to preview

### 4. Prospect Preview Page (`/ai/prospect-preview`)
- Shows the captured image and generated prospects
- Prospects are organized by category in tabs
- Users can select different prospects to view details
- **Retake Image**: Goes back to image capture
- **Close button**: Goes to dashboard and clears session data
- **View Selected Prospect**: Proceeds to detailed view

### 5. Prospect Details Page (`/ai/prospect-details/[prospectId]`)
- Shows detailed information about the selected prospect
- Includes cost breakdown, property information, and realization tips
- **Back button**: Returns to prospect preview
- **Retake button**: Goes back to image capture
- **Close button**: Goes to dashboard and clears session data
- **Add as Prospect Property**: Proceeds to add prospect form

### 6. Add Prospect Page (`/ai/add-prospect`)
- Form to add the prospect as a property to the user's portfolio
- Pre-filled with prospect data
- **Back button**: Returns to prospect details
- **Close button**: Goes to dashboard and clears session data
- **Submit**: Saves the property and redirects to prospect properties page

## Navigation Features

### Forward Navigation
- Login → Welcome → Image Capture → Prospect Preview → Prospect Details → Add Prospect

### Back Navigation
- Each page has a back button that goes to the previous page in the sequence
- Proper data persistence through sessionStorage

### Close Functionality
- Every page has a close button (X) in the top-right corner
- Clicking close from any page:
  - Clears all AI prospect session data
  - Redirects to the dashboard
  - Ensures clean state for next use

### Session Data Management
- `ai-prospects`: Generated prospect data
- `ai-prospect-image`: Captured/selected image URL
- `selected-prospect`: Currently selected prospect for detailed view

## Technical Details

### Authentication Integration
- Uses `justLoggedIn` flag from auth context
- Automatically clears flag after triggering flow
- Respects authentication state throughout

### Data Flow
- AI prospects generated using `generateSmartProspects()` and `performSmartAnalysis()` from `lib/smartProspectGenerator.ts`
- Smart image analysis performed using `identifyImageCategory()` for intelligent categorization
- Data stored in sessionStorage for navigation between pages
- Proper cleanup on flow exit

### Responsive Design
- All pages are mobile-responsive
- Proper touch interactions for mobile devices
- Optimized layouts for different screen sizes

## Usage
1. User logs in successfully
2. LoginSuccessHandler automatically redirects to welcome page
3. User can either start the AI prospect analysis or skip to dashboard
4. Throughout the flow, user can navigate back/forward or close to dashboard
5. Final step allows adding the selected prospect as a property

This implementation ensures a smooth, intuitive flow that enhances the user experience after login while providing full control over navigation and the ability to exit at any point.
